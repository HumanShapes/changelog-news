# Changelog News
A prototype for the new Changelog News pages.

Iâ€™m using Parcel to bundle the assets and run a local server. Not needed once we move this to production though. However, we will need Lightning CSS.

## How to use
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`

## Notes
- Trying to use as much modern CSS as possible. Will need to refactor before pushing to production.
